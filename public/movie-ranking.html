<h3>50 First Dates</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie. Easy to watch, funny, and you don't have to think too hard about the plot when you are watching it. </p>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>I give this one a 5/10<br />
It's cute a cute story, but I find the characters all whine far too much. I'd still recommend for a girls night though.</p>
<h3> John Wick </h3>
<p>Good story, badass fight scenes, vigilante justice. Love it.</p>
