<h1>Harry Potter Ipsum</h1>
<p>Movies ipsum Ah, music. A magic beyond all we do here! Accio Brain! Ah, music. 
  A magic beyond all we do here! I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking
   the rules? You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant... but scary
   . I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I’m not there. I am a wizard, 
   not a baboon brandishing a stick. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next 
   great adventure. Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being 
   wrong than being right. When in doubt, go to the library.</p>

  <p>The thing about growing up with Fred and George is that you sort of start thinking 
  anything's possible if you've got enough nerve. Ah, music. A magic beyond all we do
   here! Ah, music. A magic beyond all we do here! We are only as strong as we are united,
    as weak as we are divided. I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the 
    rules? Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe. I mean, it's sort of 
    exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules? I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned 
    for. I solemnly swear I am up to no good. I am what I am, an' I'm not ashamed. 'Never 
    be ashamed,' my ol' dad used ter say, 'there's some who'll hold it against you, but 
    they're not worth botherin' with.' It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our 
    enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.</p>
  
    <p>Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You 
      think the dead we loved truly ever leave us? You think that we don’t recall them 
      more clearly in times of great trouble? The thing about growing up with Fred and 
      George is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough 
      nerve. Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had 
      anywhere else to go. Don’t let the muggles get you down. I think we've outgrown full-time 
      education ... Time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon? Ah, music. A magic 
      beyond all we do here! When in doubt, go to the library. Things we lose have a way of 
      coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect. Wit beyond measure 
      is man’s greatest treasure. You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant... 
      but scary.</p>
